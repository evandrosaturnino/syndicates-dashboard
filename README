### Introduction
This project serves as a responsive dashboard for visualizing various metrics related to syndicates in liquid staking networks. It was developed as part of a hack challenge to showcase my skills and to provide valuable insights into syndicate data.

---

### Technologies Used
- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering and as the framework for building the application.
- **TypeScript**: To add static typing to JavaScript files.
- **Axios**: For making API calls to fetch syndicate data.
- **ChartJS**: For visualizing data related to syndicates.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For rapid and responsive UI development.

---

### Setup and Installation

#### Prerequisites
- NodeJS (>=12.x)
- Yarn package manager

#### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YourGithubUsername/Syndicate-Data-Visualization.git
   ```
2. Change into the project directory
   ```
   cd Syndicate-Data-Visualization
   ```
3. Install dependencies
   ```
   yarn install
   ```

4. Run the development server
   ```

### Features
- **Total Syndicate Count**: Shows the total number of syndicates across all networks.
- **Total Payout**: Displays the total payout from all syndicates.
- **Node Operators Payout**: Shows how much payout has been made to node operators.
- **Daily Payout Chart**: A line chart that shows the daily payout over time.
- **Syndicate Table**: A detailed table that displays various metrics for each syndicate, including a link to its Etherscan address.
- **Responsiveness**: The dashboard is fully responsive, thanks to Tailwind CSS, providing an optimal viewing experience on various devices.

### Challenges and Solutions

#### Data Complexity
**Challenge**: The syndicate data fetched from the a Subgraph API was complex and required significant preprocessing.

**Solution**: Created utility functions to cleanly process the data and prepare it for visualization, thus improving code reusability.

#### Time Management
**Challenge**: Due to concurrent project commitments, time management was a significant challenge.

**Solution**: Utilized Tailwind CSS for quicker UI development and ChartJS for straightforward data visualization, thus saving time.

#### Responsiveness
**Challenge**: Ensuring the dashboard is fully responsive and compatible across multiple devices.

**Solution**: Tailwind CSS was instrumental in ensuring the UI scales elegantly on different screen sizes without much manual intervention.

### Approach to the Hack Challenge
1. **Data Fetching**: Used Axios to fetch data from a Subgraph endpoint that provides information about syndicates.
2. **Data Processing**: Created utility functions to process and prepare the data for visualization.
3. **UI Components**: Created reusable UI components using Tailwind CSS to display the data.
4. **Data Visualization**: Used ChartJS to plot the daily payout data.
5. **Web3 Integration**: Used Blocknative's web3 onboard library to enable users to connect their Ethereum wallets.

---

### Future Improvements
- Implement more robust error handling.
- Add more interactive elements to the chart.
- Enable users to filter and sort the syndicate table.
